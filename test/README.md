# Signet Dump Files

The attached files represent the state of the UTXO set for blocks up to height 100. The output encoding of the UTXO set changed between Bitcoin Core 27.0 and 28.0, so a dump file from each of those versions is included.

```bash
$ bitcoin-cli invalidateblock 0000016fd99b528203933426f69da71bfcfb043b5d76ea3a219d84d5f5c85256
